## Learning Objectives

While working on the Rick and Morty Character Search project, I gained valuable experience in building a full-stack web application from scratch. The project allowed me to deepen my understanding of React components, state management, and data fetching, as well as implementing user authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with the database.

Throughout the development process, I also honed my CSS skills to create an attractive and responsive user interface, ensuring an enjoyable user experience on different devices.

The project's thematic approach, using the beloved characters from "Rick and Morty," added an element of fun and creativity to the learning experience, making the process of building this application both engaging and rewarding.

## Future Enhancements

As part of my continuous learning journey, I plan to further enhance the Rick and Morty Character Search application. Some of the planned improvements include:

- Adding more detailed information for each character.
- Implementing pagination to handle a large number of characters efficiently.
- Enhancing the user interface with animations and improved styling.
- Implementing additional user features, such as profile customization.


### 2. Pok√©dex - Explore and Create Pok√©mon
  The Pok√©dex is a web application that allows users to explore various Pok√©mon with their characteristics and detailed information. This project was developed to consolidate my knowledge acquired during the Henry Bootcamp, using the same technologies as the previous project.

### Features

- Pok√©mon Exploration: Users can view a list of Pok√©mon, their characteristics, and basic details.
- Pok√©mon Detail Page: Clicking on a Pok√©mon card reveals in-depth information about the selected Pok√©mon, including its abilities, types, and stats.
- Pok√©mon Filtering: The application provides filters to allow users to narrow down Pok√©mon based on various attributes like type, abilities, and stats.
- Cross-filtering: Users can apply multiple filters simultaneously, making it easy to perform complex searches based on combined criteria.
- Sorting Options: The Pok√©dex allows users to sort the Pok√©mon list based on attack power, alphabetical order, and HP (Hit Points).
- Pagination: To handle a large number of Pok√©mon efficiently, the Pok√©dex incorporates pagination, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Pok√©mon Creation: Authenticated users can create new Pok√©mon, adding them to the database for others to explore.
- Pok√©mon Deletion: Authenticated users can also remove Pok√©mon they've created from the Pok√©dex.

### Technology Stack

The project is built using the same technologies as the previous one:

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)

![Sequelize](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sequelize-52B0E7?logo=sequelize&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)

### Learning Objectives

Developing the Pok√©dex provided an opportunity to reinforce my understanding of React components, state management, and data fetching. The project's complexity allowed me to practice advanced filtering and sorting techniques to create a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

The inclusion of user authentication, along with the ability to create and delete Pok√©mon, deepened my knowledge of user management and secure database interactions.

By building the Pok√©dex, I gained valuable experience in handling real-world data, designing efficient user interfaces, and creating seamless interactions for users.

### Future Enhancements

As I continue to refine my skills, I have several enhancements planned for the Pok√©dex:

- Implementing more advanced sorting and filtering options for an even richer user experience.
- Improving the user interface with enhanced animations and responsive design.
- Integrating additional external Pok√©mon APIs to expand the database.
- Enhancing the user authentication system with more features like profile customization.

### 3. Accommodation Reservation App - livinng.co - Group Project
   The Accommodation Reservation App is a web application developed in a group setting, where I contributed to the frontend using Next.js. This project introduced additional technologies like Prisma on the backend. It showcases a higher complexity level, as it incorporates third-party authentication for different user types: unauthenticated client, authenticated client, host (accommodation owner), and admin (application manager). 

### Features

- Unauthenticated and Authenticated Client: Users can view accommodations initially in cards displaying images and important details. They can explore the details of each accommodation and use the search bar to find accommodations by name or location.

- Advanced Filters: Users, whether unauthenticated or authenticated, have access to advanced filters such as accommodation type, size, services, rating, and price range.

- Reservation and Offer System: Authenticated clients can make offers for desired accommodations by selecting dates and proposing prices. These reservations remain pending until the host accepts, rejects, or sends a counteroffer. Notifications for these actions are sent via email.

- Real Payment Gateway: Upon acceptance of an offer, clients receive a payment link to a real payment gateway called ePayco.

- Host Dashboard: Host users can access a dashboard where they can view reviews, manage accommodations, create new listings, edit existing ones, and handle reservations. They can also view summarized results.

- Admin Panel: The admin user can access the reservation and accommodation management systems and also handle client and host accounts.

### Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies, including the additional ones introduced:

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-E34F26?logo=html5&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-1572B6?logo=css3&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?logo=node.js&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Next.js-000000?logo=next.js&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)
![Prisma](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prisma-2D3748?logo=prisma&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)

### Learning and Contribution

During the development of the Accommodation Reservation App, I participated primarily in the design and functionality of the calendar used to select reservation dates. Additionally, I worked on the accommodation, reservation, client, and host views for both the admin and host users. I also designed modals for accepting, rejecting, or counteroffering reservations, as well as pausing, resuming, or deleting accommodations. Other responsibilities included handling email contact and programming token information based on user types for most requests.

Furthermore, I contributed to the information pages, such as "About Us," "Terms and Conditions," and "FAQs."

### Agile Development

The project was completed for a real client using agile methodologies, specifically Scrum, ensuring efficiency and iterative progress throughout the development process.

### Future Enhancements

As the Accommodation Reservation App continues to grow, we plan to make several enhancements, such as:

- Improving the user interface and user experience to ensure a smooth and delightful booking process.
- Expanding the payment gateway options to accommodate various user preferences.
- Enhancing notification systems to keep users informed of any important updates or changes.
